# GB-Oxide

GB-Oxide is a Game Boy/DMG emulator created using Rust. Currently supports CPU emulation and basic PPU emulation. The current color palette uses shades of blue instead of the original shades of gray. Currently able to play Tetris with minor graphical glitches. 

## TODOs:
- Fix graphical glitches
- Audio
- Get more complex games to work
  - Memory bank support
  - SRAM emulation and support for saves
